# Liferay Permission Hook

This is a hook that customizes Liferay Portal in order to allow administrator to manage users permissions based on their sending and receiving organizations.

I am proud of it because through it, I can demonstrate my ability in solving problem. Because Liferay Portal is a really complex system, and to adjust the system which is built on Liferay, required me to dig in the Liferay core's source code to understand how it works and find a solution for the integration issue.
